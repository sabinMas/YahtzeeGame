Setup
- Each player should take a score sheet and a pen or pencil.
- To decide who goes first, each player rolls all 5 dice. The player with the highest total goes first.
- Play proceeds clockwise after the first turn.
On Your Turn
Each turn, you are allowed to roll the dice up to three times to score as many points as possible.
1. First Roll:
   - Roll all 5 dice.
   - You can stop and score or choose to roll again.
   - If rolling again, you can re-roll any or all dice.
2. Second Roll:
   - Re-roll any dice that are not "keepers" from the previous roll.
   - You may stop and score or roll again.
3. Third Roll:
   - You may re-roll any or all dice, including keepers.
   - After this roll, you must score in a box.
Scoring Rules
- You must fill in a box on every turn.
- You cannot score in the same box twice.
- If you cannot score in any category, you must write a zero in any available box.
- The score sheet is divided into Upper Section and Lower Section.
Upper Section
In the upper section, you only count dice of a specific number:
- Aces (Ones): Total of all ones rolled.
- Twos: Total of all twos rolled.
- Threes: Total of all threes rolled.
- Fours: Total of all fours rolled.
- Fives: Total of all fives rolled.
- Sixes: Total of all sixes rolled.
Bonus:
If your Upper Section total is 63 points or more, you receive a 35-point bonus.
(Achieved by rolling at least three of each number: 3+6+9+12+15+18 = 63.)
Perfect Score:
The highest possible score in the upper section is 140 points (if rolling five of each number).
Lower Section
The lower section consists of special combinations:
- Three of a Kind:
  - At least three of the same number.
  - Score = sum of all dice.
- Four of a Kind:
  - At least four of the same number.
  - Score = sum of all dice.
- Full House:
  - Three of one number and two of another.
  - Score = 25 points.
- Small Straight:
  - A sequence of four consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4).
  - Score = 30 points.
- Large Straight:
  - A sequence of five consecutive numbers (e.g., 2-3-4-5-6).
  - Score = 40 points.
- YAHTZEE (Five of a Kind):
  - All five dice are the same number.
  - Score = 50 points.
- YAHTZEE BONUS:
  - If you roll a second YAHTZEE after already scoring 50 points,
    you receive 100 extra points.
  - Place a checkmark in the YAHTZEE BONUS box.
  - You may also score in an available Upper Section box.
  - If the appropriate Upper Section box is filled, you may score in any Lower Section box.
Example:
You roll five fours.
- If you havenâ€™t scored YAHTZEE yet, you mark 50 points.
- If you already have a YAHTZEE, you score 100 bonus points.
- If "Fours" is already filled in, you may use it for another category (e.g., Large Straight).
